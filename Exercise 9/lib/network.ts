        **Current State:**
        - Articles found: ${state?.articles?.length || 0}  
        - Sentiments analyzed: ${state?.sentiments?.length || 0} 
        - Posts created: ${state?.posts?.length || 0}

        **Available Agents:**
        ${agents.map((a) => `- ${a.name}: ${a.description}`).join("\n")}  

        **Your Job:**
        1. Analyze the current state  
        2. Decide which agent should run next to progress the workflow 
        3. Use route_to_agent tool to select the next agent 
        4. Use done tool when all steps are complete and content is approved  

        **Workflow Logic:**
        - If no articles: route to "News Scout"  
        - If articles but no sentiments: route to "Sentiment Analyzer" 
        - If sentiments but no posts: route to "Content Creator"  
        - If posts but no posters: route to "Poster Designer" 
        - If everything done but not approved: route to "Moderator"  
        - If approved: call done 

        Think step by step and make the best decision!
